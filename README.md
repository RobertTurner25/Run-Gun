This is my first videogame project created using Unity. Right now it's called Run & Gun, and is still in very early development. While the game works as it is, and you can play it, 
and try to beat your own high score, there is still plenty more functionality and design I have to figure out before I can call it a finished project. 
The most obvious thing I have left to work on is implementing the shooting functionality, as well as enemies on the course for your to shoot and dodge. 
My main goal with this project was to create my first working videogame using Unity though, and I have accomplished that goal with this project and have learned a lot about
programming and game development in the process. 

ALSO, all of my #C code for this project can be found in the Scripts folder that's in the Asset folder.
